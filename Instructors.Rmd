<!-- Prof. Beatriz Martínez López (DVM, MPVM, PhD) is Professor in the Department of Medicine and Epidemiology, Agricultural Experiment Station (20%) faculty and Director of the UC Davis Center for Animal Disease Modeling and Surveillance (CADMS). Her research is focused on the development and application of epidemiological tools for supporting more cost-effective and risk-based surveillance and control strategies. She has primarily been working on epidemiological modeling and risk assessment for the evaluation of the potential introduction and/or spread of diseases affecting domestic and/or wild animal populations, such as foot-and-mouth disease, African swine fever, classical swine fever, bovine tuberculosis, Aujeszky´s disease, African horse sickness, bluetongue, avian influenza, West Nile, and Rift Valley Fever. Many of these diseases are considered to be emerging or re-emerging due to globalization, changes in climate and land use.  -->

<!-- Since 2005, she has been collaborating closely with CADMS on projects related to international modeling and surveillance. Recently, she become the director of CADMS, leading the continuing development of new near-real time surveillance and modeling tools and their integration into operational platforms such as the Disease BioPortal, a secure web-based platform system intended for real time routing, sharing, and analyzing animal disease data and information (http://bioportal.ucdavis.edu/). -->

<!-- In the last eight years, she has had the opportunity to collaborate in many national and international research projects and collaborative agreements with government agencies and other bodies. These projects have allowed her to gain experience in epidemiological evaluation, communication and technology transfer in several countries and under very diverse scenarios and audiences (e.g. general public, farmers, private and official veterinarians, consumers, policy makers, etc.). Dr. Martínez López has served a as mentor, advisor or committee member for 13 Masters and PhD students. She has been active in several national and international scientific associations, including service in six scientific committees. She has also been involved in organizing a number of international conferences related to veterinary epidemiology and virology.   -->

# Jose Pablo Gomez-Vazquez

<img src ="Images/Headshot.png" style="width:20%;float:left">

Pablo is a post-doctoral researcher at the Center for Animal Disease Modeling and Surveillance (CADMS). His research interest includes spatio-temporal modeling of infectious diseases. Pablo earned his DVM in Mexico, and his MPVM and PhD at UC Davis. During the last couple of years, he has been working with methods for analysis and modeling of complex systems (i.e. network theory and agent based modeling). He is interested in the development of open intuitive and open access frameworks that can be used for disease surveillance and risk communication.

Jerome earned his PhD from the University of California, Davis, working in CADMS. His thesis focused on analysing rabies surveillance data in Cambodia and creating disease spread models. During his time at CADMS he also conducted a project on analysing trade networks in the Argentine swine industry. He currently works as an epidemiologist at the National Veterinary Institute of Sweden where his main project focuses on estimating the freedom probability for Chronic Wasting Disease in reindeer and modelling its spread in the case of introduction.

# Shadira Gordon

<img src ="Images/SG.jpg" style="width:15%;float:left">  

Obtained her DVM from the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) in 2019, and her MPVM from the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) in 2022. Currently, she is a Ph.D. student in the Graduate Group in Epidemiology at UC Davis and a graduate student researcher in the Center for Animal Disease Modeling and Surveillance (CADMS).
In partnership with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA), she is working on a user-friendly risk assessment tool to better prevent and control Equine Herpesvirus Myeloencephalopathy in the U.S.
Her main interests are creating strategies for emerging zoonotic threats preparedness, improving global disease surveillance systems, and preventing and controlling infectious diseases through a One Health approach.

<!-- # José Manuel Díaz Cao -->

<!-- <img src ="Images/JM.jpg" style="width:20%;float:left">   -->

<!-- Dr. José Manuel Díaz Cao (DVM, PhD) is a postdoctoral researcher interested in the epidemiology of infectious diseases. He has been working on risk factor analysis and the characterization and modeling of the ways in which diseases are transmitted and maintained in animal populations. He obtained his doctorate at the University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain, and his dissertation focused on reproductive pathogens in domestic ruminants, the analysis of the determinants of exposure and outbreaks, the detection of spatio-temporal trends and how to take advantage of the information generated on farms to anticipate and mitigate risks. He has extended this work to a wide number of pathogens in different animal species, including livestock, wildlife and zoonotic diseases. He also is experienced in the environmental detection of infectious pathogens, laboratory diagnosis and epidemiological and statistical analysis. He is collaborating with the department in the application and development of new methods and epidemiological monitoring systems that allow the information generated in livestock and animal health to be used to inform early on the risks on animal health in order to improve and optimize control, biosecurity and surveillance of infectious pathogens.    -->
